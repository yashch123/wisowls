Matching app for dog owners. Owners can create a profile to their dog, browse through profiles of other dogs, and match with other owners! Owners are matched if they both chose to match (just like Tinder). Then, owners can arrange activities like play-dates, dog-sitting, etc. The app will also recommend owners based on input preferences (e.g. "Dog is well-behaved around children").
